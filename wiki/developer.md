# Open Pipe Kit for Developers

## About
Howdy dev. Welcome to the Open Pipe Kit project. We've been doing weekly online hangouts sharing ideas and insights we've had around pulling data from sensors and pushing data to databases. In the process we've come up with a couple of ideas we think are going to make all of our lives easier. We're interested in your thoughts so please do join us if you have any questions or insights. Our weekly hangout is at 8pm EDT at [this url](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/rjsteinert.com/rj), our issue queue is [here](https://github.com/openpipekit/openpipekit/issues), and our mailing list is [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-pipe-kit). Lastly, if you have any trouble understanding these docs, we would love if you showed up to our weekly hangout so we can give you a hand.
